Hello.

This library is meant to outfit Rokoko Motion Capture Gloves for gesture recogntion.

Rokoko's api is in baby stages and has some serious quirks. Most of these are handled, but there
is also a Blender project that serves as a work around if needed- see previous version of README.

Current fucntionality is changing rapidly but is at this time adapted for use with the right 
glove only, though this is easily changeable and is only done for simplicity in the short run. 
There is a gui available but is in development. Any gesture recogntion works but may be unstable 
due to rapid iteration. 

Yours in Coding, 
Nathan Gollay
